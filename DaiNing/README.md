#DaiNing Project

This is the first python side project I'v done which is requested by my gf with some basic tools for scraping, pandas and numpy.
The purpose of the project is to figure out whether goverment agencies in Taoyuan City uploaded
budget proposal for years in interest. Opening each website by hand is a waste of time because 
there are almost a hundred orginizations we have to check, and it's just maybe 1/10 of all btw.

Here's an example:
Go to website https://www.dayuan.tycg.gov.tw/home.jsp?id=40&parentpath=0,5&mcustomize=multimessages_list.jsp&qclass=201410290024
and you'll find a list of budget proposal for each year as shown below.

First thing
